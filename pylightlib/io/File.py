==================

This module provides functionality for reading, writing, and managing text files
efficiently. It offers a simple and lightweight interface for handling
text-based file operations.

Version:
    0.1

This module includes functions and classes to work with text files, such as
reading content, writing data, appending text and performing basic file
manipulations. It is designed to simplify text file handling in Python projects
by providing an easy-to-use API.

Features:
- Read content from text files.
- Write content to text files.
- Append data to existing files.
- Handle file encoding issues.
- Support for line-by-line reading to optimize memory usage.

This module is particularly useful for applications requiring efficient and
straightforward text file operations, such as logging systems, data processing
and configuration management.
