This module contains Windows-specific functionality for the PyLight GUI
framework. Currently, it provides a workaround for blurry fonts in Tkinter on
high-DPI displays by adjusting the scaling factor using native Windows API calls
via `ctypes`.

It defines the `PyLightTk_Windows` class with static methods that can be called
during application setup to ensure consistent UI scaling and sharper font
rendering on modern displays.
