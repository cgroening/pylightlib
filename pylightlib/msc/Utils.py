        """
        Calculates the next index in a list based on the current index, the length of the list and the direction of movement.

        Parameters
        ----------
        current_index : int
            The current index in the list.
        length : int
            The length of the list.
        direction : int, optional
            The direction of movement
            (1 for forward, -1 for backward).
        loop_behavior : bool, optional
            If True, the index will wrap around when reaching
            the start or end of the list. If False, the index will be
            clamped within the bounds of the list.

        Returns
        -------
        int
            The calculated next index.

        Notes
        -----
        When `loop_behavior` is `True`, the expression
        `(current_index + direction) % length` ensures that the index
        always stays within the valid range from `0` to `length - 1`.
        The modulo operator (%) makes the index "wrap around":

            - If the index moves past the end of the list, it wraps back
              to 0.
            - If the index moves before the beginning, it wraps to the
            last position.

        Examples
        --------
        For a list of length 5 (indices 0 to 4):

        >>> (4 + 1) % 5  # moves from the end to the start
        0
        >>> (0 - 1) % 5  # moves from the start to the end
        4
        >>> (2 + 1) % 5  # normal forward movement
        3
        >>> (2 - 1) % 5  # normal backward movement
        1
