pylightlib.msc.SysPathHandler
=============================

Provides functionality to dynamically manipulate `sys.path` and module imports
for loading Qt libraries (e.g., PySide6, shiboken6) from external sources.

Version:
    0.1

This module is designed to support LGPL compliance for applications using Qt
bindings by allowing dynamic linking of PySide6 and shiboken6. It ensures that
users can replace these libraries in frozen applications (e.g., .app bundles
on macOS).

Key Features:
- `activate_dynamic_qt_linking`: Configures `sys.path` and import logic for
frozen macOS apps or when debug mode is active.
- `SysPathHandler`: A singleton utility class that handles:
    - Temporarily replacing `sys.path` to load libraries from external
      locations.
    - Cleaning `sys.modules` to avoid importing from the virtual environment
      in debug mode.
    - Restoring the original `sys.path` after external packages are imported.

Platform Support:
- **macOS only** for frozen applications.
- Debug mode also works during development across platforms.

Usage Example (for debug mode or frozen deployment)::

```
SysPathHandler().set_new_sys_path()
try:
    from PySide6 import QtWidgets
except ImportError as e:
    print(f'Import Error ({__file__}):\\n    ' + str(e.msg))
    exit()
SysPathHandler().restore_sys_path()
```

This approach helps in staying compliant with LGPL by enabling runtime
substitution of Qt libraries by the end-user.

    Enables dynamic linking for Qt packages (PySide6 and shiboken6) to ensure
    LGPL compliance. The folder external_libs_folder must have the same parent
    folder as the .app bundle. This way the user can exchange the PySide/Qt
    file for his own (requirement from the LGPL).

    FROZEN APP ONLY: This functionality only works for bundled/frozen apps.
    During development the Qt packages are imported from the virtual
    environment unless debug mode is enabled. Then, the packages will be
    imported from external_libs_folder_debug_mode.

    MAC ONLY: This is only necessary on macOS, because on Windows cx_freeze
    automatically creates a folder with the .exe and the Qt libs which can be
    exchanged.

    Args:
        external_libs_folder: Name of the folder that contains PySide6 and
                              shiboken6. It must be placed next to the
                              .app bundle.
        external_libs_folder_debug_mode: Absolute path of the external lib
                                         folder - used in debug mode.
        debug_mode: If this is on the Qt files are imported from the absolute
                    path external_libs_folder_debug_mode.

    This class provides functionality to dynamically manage the `sys.path`

    external libraries (e.g., PySide6) are loaded from a designated path,

    To allow the debug mode to function correctly the import of external
    packages must be as follows:
